# BioBytes - Life's Encapsulation

## Description

BioBytes is a marvel of modern science, the cherished child of a biology daydream and a Python coding marathon. It's an artificial life simulator that lets you build your own virtual ecosystem teeming with organisms that behave in a strangely life-like manner. They move, eat, grow, reproduce and, if that's not enough, they also evolve!
